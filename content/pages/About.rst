About
=====

I wear many hats. These include: computational scientist, programmer and 
system administrator. More recently I have been referred to as a BioIT
specialist.

I make it easier to answer questions about biological data using computational 
approaches. My present focus is with Next-generation sequencing technologies. 
I am making it rapid and efficient to analyse this big and complex data. 
Previously I focused on data describing the structure of biological assemblies.

I write mainly python code.

I predominantly manage Linux servers in context of configuration, security, 
web services and data management. I also get to play around in high 
performance computing environments.

In my spare time I will be either fishing, keeping my dogs active or 
renovating our 60 year old house.
